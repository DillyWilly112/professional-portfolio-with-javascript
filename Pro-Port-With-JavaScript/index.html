            <p>Hello My name is Frederick Vaca and I came from a small town in Ohio called New Philadelphia.There's not
                much to tell but here's my story!</p>
            <p>Before becoming a software developer I served four years in the Marine Corps as a Combat Engineer. During
                the time I spent in the Marine Corps I went to five different countries and went on two deployments. I
                was able to gain a lot of leadership knowledge and experience, as well as the ability to work well under
                pressure!</p>

                    <h3>Required Tasks</h3>
                    <p>Create a virtual pet application. This is your version of a Tamagotchi or DigiPet! This might
                        seem like a daunting task, but we can break it down.
                        Think of which instance variables and methods you will need. We give suggestions below. Remember
                        that instance variables represent the state of your pet. Methods represent the behavior of your
                        pet, which would include its responses to you feeding or playing with it.
                        Most games include what is called a game loop, a loop which updates everything in the game,
                        representing the passage of time. We exit this loop when something happens that should cause the
                        game to end. Include a tick() method (think clocks, not parasites) in your VirtualPet class
                        representing the passage of a unit of time. This should do things like update instance variables
                        of VirtualPet that are time dependent, such as hunger or thirst. You should call the tick() to
                        represent the passage of time after each interaction with the user.
                        There is always some confusion with this tick() method. It has some flexibility, what you are
                        doing is changing the properties of your Virtual Pet at some rate in this method…every time this
                        method is called, those properties specified in this method would update.</p>

                        should contribute to either (optionally, create accessor methods to retrieve these values
                        instead):
                        amount of waste in the litter box

                        Create a Review class for the content of reviews. Its instance variables (attributes) should
                        include:
                        id (make this of type long – you’ll find out why later) – just use arbitrary, unique numbers for
                        these ids
                        title
                        image url
                        review category
                        content
                        whatever other things you’d like to include. Some ideas:
                        date
                        description/synopsis
                        <h4>Create a ReviewRepository class:</h4>
                        <p>This class should be annotated properly so that it can be injected into ReviewsController.
                            It should have a constructor that creates your Review instances and populates a Map that
                            stores your reviews, using each review’s id as the map key.
                            It should have a method to find all reviews
                            It should have a method to find one review by id</p>
                        <h4>Create a ReviewsController class.</h4>
                        <p>apply proper annotation
                            It should inject…something appropriately
                            It should have a method mapped to a url that puts all of your reviews into the model,
                            forwarding to a “reviews” template.
                            It should have a method mapped to a url including an id parameter that puts one of your
                            reviews into the model, forwarding to a “review” template. This method should expect an “id”
                            query parameter in order to select a specific review.
                            Place images you use into your src/main/resources/static/images folder and link to them
                            there. Example: if your image is in src/main/resources/static/images/foo.jpg, you would
                            reference it in your application as /images/foo.jpg.
                            Use your html/css-fu to style to your pages consistently and to make them appealing.</p>
